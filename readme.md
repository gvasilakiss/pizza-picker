## Installation

Before using the "Pizza Picker" package, you need to install it. As it seems to be a local package in your example, let's adjust the instructions for a scenario where the package is available on npm. If the package is not published to npm yet, you can refer to the instructions for local setup.

### For an npm package:

```bash
npm install pizza-picker
```

### For local setup:

Ensure you have PizzaSelector.js and pizzas.js in your project, then:

```javascript
const pizzaSelector = require('./path/to/PizzaSelector');
```

## Usage

After installation, you can easily get pizza recommendations:


```javascript
// Get any random pizza
console.log(pizzaSelector.getRandomPizza());

// Get a random vegetarian pizza
console.log(pizzaSelector.getRandomPizzaByCategory('vegetarian'));

// Get a random vegan pizza
console.log(pizzaSelector.getRandomPizzaByCategory('vegan'));
```

That's it! Enjoy exploring diverse and delicious pizza options. ‚úî
